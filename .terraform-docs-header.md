# AWS Lambda EKS Apply Terraform Module

This module wraps up some functionality to dynamically apply Kubernetes templated manifests to an EKS cluster via normal Terraform provisioning flows.

We will build out these docs as we move forward, but see the [example directory](./examples/) for usage in the meantime.

## Why?

* Provisioning an EKS cluster along w/ installing some basic things in to it to start is hard
* It's impossible if you use Terraform in dynamic ways
* People want a solution to this problem w/o using the kubectl, kubernetes, etc. providers...
* [A provider exists to address this problem](https://github.com/jmorris0x0/terraform-provider-k8sconnect)
* But maybe we don't need a full provider, just this module for specific needs like EKS

> [!WARN]
> This module is not meant to install complex workloads or other resources into Kubernetes. Keep using other tools for that. **This is primarily meant to be used for bootstrapping chicken/egg type resources into your cluster so you can have the other deployment tools take over from there.**
